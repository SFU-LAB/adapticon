#### Notes from discussion following 2023-02-13 Diapix Pilot

##### Task adjustments
* two pairs of sets of cards, shuffled, laid out in front of the Ps
* flip one card at a time, and if they match then remove the two cards  
* I can't find the name of this game other than "Memory game" <-- it's called [concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game))

##### Equipment display adjustments
* may work better as a computer display because of paper noise being recorded
	* trackpad instead of a mouse as well
* could project the pics and prompts onto the side wall
	* projector would get very hot though, and would be very loud
	* a monitor might be fine
	* turn monitor sideways?
* have the screen/projection near the person's head, rather than on the table, with the goal of making Ps look at each other's faces
* if the monitors are above the head, then it would be very automatic for them to lower their eyes right after
	* we're not motivating the eye movement; it just happens naturally
	* better than having the screen on the table in front of the other participant's chest
* teleprompter would be too expensive to build for that distance
* It's so natural nowadays to talk without looking away from the monitor that its possible to do the task without eye contact
	* could turn screen off
	* but, eyes/neck could get too tired from constantly moving up and down
* the distance between seated Ps may make a difference; a certain distance where looking right at the other P would be comfortable - just need to find it; may be 1-1.5m?
* microHDMI to HDMI converter
