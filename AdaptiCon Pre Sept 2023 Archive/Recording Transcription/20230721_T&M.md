00:18:08 M 
Is it like she's writing right? 
00:18:10 T 
Ohh no. Mine's riding. 
00:18:12 M 
Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I thought, OK, that was my bad. Let me take that away. 
00:18:17 T 
OK. Do you have a rider with a black background or no? Maybe there's something else that we have. 
00:18:22 T 
I took mine off too. 
00:18:23 T 
*Inaudible* 
00:18:25 M 
Do you have? 
00:18:26 M 
There's like a leader. There's like a woman leading people. 
00:18:31 T 
I don't have it. 
00:18:33 T 
I have a. Do you have? I don't know what it's called like a like... a kiss? 
00:18:37 M 
Ohh, I have that. is it on a... 
00:18:39 M 
On a blue screen? 
00:18:40 M 
Yeah, OK. This whole time. So I'm so sorry about the rider thing. 
00:18:44 T 
No, no, it's OK. It's OK. 
00:18:47 T 
It's funny that it was the last. 
00:18:48 T 
One that we did like, it's so close. 
00:18:52 T 
OK. Did we get it? No? 
00:18:54 M 
Did we get it? 
00:18:56 M 
What? I thought we had everything. 
00:18:58 M 
wait, is the door open? 
00:19:01 Researcher 
There's still one more. 
00:19:06 T 
OK, let's go reverse order this time. 
00:19:08 M 
OK, we're gonna reverse. 
00:19:09 T&M 
M: So, we did the person kissing someone on the cheek. 
T: Yeah, and then... 
00:19:15 T 
The meal one, the meal. 
00:19:17 M 
Did I put maybe? 
00:19:18 M 
Did I put the wrong color background? 
00:19:20 T 
Did you put this sheep like the animal? 
00:19:24 M 
Right after the meal? 
T: Yeah 
M: Yeah. 
00:19:31 T 
what's... 
00:19:32 T 
What's different? 
00:19:34 M 
I'm wondering, maybe one of us -- wait, could be me -- like --- put the wrong colored background. 
00:19:41 M 
Ohh, it's hard to see to see like. 
00:19:45 M 
It's so dark, I'm trying to pick it up. 
00:19:50 T 
I have a sheep. 
00:20:00 T 
OK, wait, let's just try for the images. 
00:20:04 T 
Axe a pickaxe? 
00:20:08 T 
The mill? 
00:20:11 M 
What color is the pickaxe on your wall? 
00:20:13 T 
Yellow. 
00:20:14 M 
OK, mine's yellow too. 
00:20:16 T 
And then the mill, I think it was pink. 
00:20:21 T 
It looks red. 
00:20:22 M 
It looks red. Yeah, either red or pink on mine. I can't pick it up. 
00:20:26 T 
I think it was red. I mean I think it was pink. 
00:20:30 T 
And then the hill, like the mountain. 
00:20:33 M 
Oh my gosh, I can't pick it up because they're right. So, there's one of these. If we keep clicking, if we keep clicking... 
00:20:43 M 
One of them is bound to be wrong. 
00:20:47 T 
OK, wait. But. 
00:20:49 T 
Ohh wait, OK, this suit. What did you have for the suit? 
00:20:54 T 
I had suit like the wearing thing. Suit like next to the beans. 
00:20:59 T 
What did you have? 
00:21:00 M 
I had like those little dust bunnies. 
00:21:02 T 
Oh, no, no, no, I didn't have it. 
00:21:05 T 
M: Where did I place it? Where was that place again?  
T: that was next to the Bean and the Peel. 
00:21:14 T 
OK. 
00:21:15 T 
What do we have that matches now though? 
00:21:16 T 
I'm taking mine off the wall 
00:21:18 M 
OK, Oh my God that's so funny. 
00:21:24 T 
OK. 
00:21:27 T 
Do you have the cod? the codfish? 
00:21:29 M 
I have a codfish. 
00:21:30 M 
But it's on a red background. 
00:21:32 T 
Oh, do you have a... Another bat—Batter?  
00:21:34 T&M 
M: batter... like the one doing the ball? 
T: Yeah  
M: No.  
00:21:40 T&M 
M: Did you have another banana peel?  
T: No, I didn't have another peel. I had the budder. 
00:21:50 T 
Like the plant butt-- budding. 
00:21:55 T 
Did you have that one? 
00:21:56 M 
I have to double-check. 
00:21:59 M 
No. Do you have like maybe? 
00:22:05 M 
Or maybe like a girl writing something. 
00:22:08 T 
No, I just have someone -- a girl riding. 
00:22:13 T 
Not someone writing. 
00:22:14 T&M 
M: Do you have another sheep?  
T: No. 
M: How about another meal background? The meal with a yellow background? 
00:22:22 T 
No. Do you have another pill? 
00:22:27 M 
No. How about a pedal with the yellow background? 
00:22:32 T 
No. Do you have a chick? 
00:22:33 M 
I don't have any chicks. 
00:22:35 T 
Do you have a metal? 
00:22:37 M 
What does the metal look like? 
00:22:40 
We'll just call it because you have to go to class. 
T: wait. What was the matching one? 
00:22:45 Researcher 
I don’t remember, but it’s there 
00:22:48 M 
We were so close! 
00:22:51 T 
Wait, can I look at her screen? 
00:22:54 M 
Can you look at my screen?  
Researcher: Sure. 
00:22:56 T 
Can I -- if it's OK? 
00:22:58 
Yeah.  
00:23:00 M 
Because I was looking for this. 
00:23:01 T 
No, I don't have it. Wait, no. 
00:23:02 M 
How about this? 
00:23:06 T 
But no, there's no matching. 
00:23:07 
Yeah. We wanna do something with [M]. 
00:23:12 T 
But I don't think that there's another matching pair. 
00:23:13 
Maybe it's one of them that got invisible maybe? 
00:23:15 M 
Ohh yeah, because I thought I picked it up because I dropped it here. 
00:23:19 T 
I dropped an invisible one and then. 
00:23:20 M 
She dropped an invisible one. 
00:23:21 T 
I just ditched it.  
00:23:22 Researcher 
Yeah, probably that's the one. 
00:23:23 T 
Ohh I can’t find it though. 
00:23:24 Researcher 
Yeah, yeah. 
00:23:26 M 
OK. OK. Thank you so much. 
00:23:29 M 
Yeah, that was that was fun. 
00:23:31 
Yeah. What was it? 
00:23:33 Researcher 
We have to debrief you. 
00:23:36 Researcher 
The battery just died, so it's perfect timing. 
00:23:38 T 
OK. 
00:23:39 Researcher 
OK, so let's have [M] do the recording and then we debrief, OK? 
00:23:45 T 
Do you want me to leave or stay? 
00:23:47 
Yes, you can leave. 
00:23:47 
OK. 
00:23:51 T 
Oh, what are you recording? 
00:23:52 M 
I guess I have to record my list of words again. 
00:23:55 T 
I understand.
