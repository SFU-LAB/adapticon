# AdaptiCon
This is the wiki for a new multi-year project in LAB lab on phonetic adaptation. The proper full name of the project is *Adaptations in Conversations* and it started circa mid-2022.

We have split the project into three main portions:

[AdaptiCon-Vowel](https://github.com/SFU-LAB/adapticon/blob/51120e74e563fe5a75c80b80bad93ad7d5329a07/adapticon-vowel.md) is mainly concerned about adaptations in English.

[AdaptiCon-Tone](https://github.com/SFU-LAB/adapticon/blob/51120e74e563fe5a75c80b80bad93ad7d5329a07/adapticon-tone.md) is mainly concerned about adaptations in Cantonese tones.

[AdaptiCon-AI](https://github.com/SFU-LAB/adapticon/blob/51120e74e563fe5a75c80b80bad93ad7d5329a07/adapticon-ai.md) is mainly concerned about adaptations between a human and a non-human voice.

[This](https://github.com/SFU-LAB/adapticon/tree/main/Papers) is a list of all literatures we have read and reviewed.

[This](https://github.com/SFU-LAB/adapticon/blob/51120e74e563fe5a75c80b80bad93ad7d5329a07/Useful%20Resources.md) is a list of useful resources we have found during our research.
